# Balance Notes (Deferred)

This document captures **minimum recommended balance adjustments** discussed but **not implemented** yet. These are intended to improve competitive balance without changing win conditions or core flow.

## Minimum Recommended Changes

1) **Cap discount per build at 1 energy**
- Discount effects remain temporary.
- Only **one total energy** is reduced per build, regardless of how many discount effects are pending.
- Goal: prevent discount stacking from making high‑cost nodes too easy.

2) **Multiplier gives +1 output only (non‑stacking)**
- Multiple multiplier effects on the same output do **not** stack.
- Total bonus for a given output is **+1**.
- Goal: avoid runaway output growth that makes protocol rushing dominant.

## Why These Matter

- Keeps **discount** useful but not dominant.
- Keeps **multiplier** impactful but controlled.
- Maintains multiple viable win paths (Efficiency / Network / Protocols).

## Status

**Not implemented.**  
Revisit after more playtesting or once full effect tuning is planned.
