# LEGAL COMPLIANCE & IP-SAFE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

*(Purpose: Avoid copyright, trademark, and trade-dress infringement related to Splendor)*

---

## ✅ REDESIGN COMPLETE - Quantum Nexus Fully Playable

**Status**: Core single-player game fully implemented and ready for testing!

---

## 1. Product Identity — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**
The name *Splendor* and any confusingly similar branding are trademark-protected. Even indirect references increase takedown risk.

**✅ Completed**
- App name: "Quantum Nexus"
- Logo: Hexagon with lightning bolt
- Splash screen: Sci-fi tech theme with grid background
- All UI text updated
- No Splendor references anywhere

**Legal basis**: Trademark infringement + likelihood of confusion. **RESOLVED** ✅

---

## 2. Resource System — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**
The gem colors, types, and mappings are a core identifying expression of Splendor's visual and mechanical identity.

**✅ Completed**
- 4 Energy Types (not 5): Solar, Hydro, Plasma, Neural
- Flux (not Gold): Purple gradient wild energy with special rules
- Different icons: Zap, Droplet, Flame, Brain, Sparkles
- Different color scheme: Yellow, Cyan, Pink, Green, Purple
- Different acquisition rules

**Legal basis**: Trade dress (distinctive look & feel), derivative expression. **RESOLVED** ✅

---

## 3. Card System Structure — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**
A tiered permanent-discount card economy is a recognizable mechanical fingerprint, even if rules are not copyrighted.

**✅ Completed**
- 4 thematic categories (not 3 tiers): Research, Production, Network, Control
- Temporary/conditional effects (not permanent discounts)
- Multipliers, swaps, draws, situational discounts
- No fixed cost curves
- No visible tier hierarchy
- Different visual layout

**Legal basis**: Derivative work risk through mechanical replication + UI similarity. **RESOLVED** ✅

---

## 4. Nobles / Milestones — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**
Automatic nobles triggered by resource thresholds are uniquely associated with Splendor.

**✅ Completed**
- "Protocols" with tech names
- Must be actively claimed (not auto-trigger)
- Provide ongoing effects (not just points)
- Based on output generation (not resources held)
- Tech/abstract imagery (no aristocracy)

**Legal basis**: Trade dress + unique system association. **RESOLVED** ✅

---

## 5. Board & UI Layout — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**
Mirroring the tabletop layout constitutes "look and feel" duplication, even with original art.

**✅ Completed**
- Vertical scrolling mobile-first design
- Tab-based navigation (Market / Protocols / Players)
- No central bank layout
- No symmetric card rows
- Compact bottom player area
- Modal interactions

**Legal basis**: Trade dress infringement (visual similarity). **RESOLVED** ✅

---

## 6. Scoring & Victory Conditions — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**
A fixed score-race end condition is strongly associated with the original game.

**✅ Completed**
- Multiple win conditions:
  - 20★ Efficiency (after turn 20)
  - 12+ Nodes built
  - 3+ Protocols claimed
- "Efficiency" terminology (not "points/prestige")
- Variable thresholds

**Legal basis**: Derivative gameplay structure risk. **RESOLVED** ✅

---

## 7. Iconography & Visual Language — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**

**✅ Completed**
- Tech icons from Lucide React

- No crowns or noble motifs
- Sci-fi gradient aesthetic
- Purple-cyan color palette
- Holographic card effects

**Legal basis**: Copyrighted visual expression + trade dress. **RESOLVED** ✅

---

## 8. Color Semantics — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**
Color-function alignment identical to Splendor increases recognizability.

**✅ Completed**
- Different color set: Yellow, Cyan, Pink, Green, Purple
- Different meanings: Solar, Hydro, Plasma, Neural, Flux
- Gradient backgrounds (not solid)
- Icon-based differentiation

**Legal basis**: Trade dress similarity. **RESOLVED** ✅

---

## 9. Terminology — **COMPLETE** ✅

**Why this must change**
Specific nouns and verbs from the original rules constitute protected expression.

- Points/Prestige → Efficiency
- Levels/Tiers → Categories
- Bonus → Output

**Legal basis**: Copyrighted text and phrasing. **RESOLVED** ✅

**Why this must change**
Even original wording that follows the same instructional structure can be considered derivative.

**✅ Completed**
